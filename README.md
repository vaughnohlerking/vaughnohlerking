Hi! Iâ€™m @vaughnohlerking. I'm a sophomore-junior studying for a Software Engineering major and Math minor at Louisiana State University. As of late I have been really interested in algorithms and numerical methods, especially relating to optimization. I'm currently learning about operating systems and web programming. Im hoping to soon move on to learning about AI and machine learning.
