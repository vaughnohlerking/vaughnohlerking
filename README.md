Hi! Iâ€™m @vaughnohlerking. I graduated from Louisiana State University in the fall of 2022 with a bachelors in Computer Science. My concentration was Software Engineering and I also completed a minor in Mathematics. Currently, I'm a Frontend Engineer at Vigilus (formerly known as Crimer) and I hope to develop my skills to be able to do full stack development and hopefully eventually build more complicated softwares.
Not actively looking for employment but casually perusing options.
