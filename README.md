Hi! Iâ€™m @vaughnohlerking. I'm a junior-senior studying for a Software Engineering major and Mathematics minor at Louisiana State University. As of late I have been really interested in algorithms and numerical methods, especially relating to optimization. I'm currently learning about software engineering, programming languages, aritificial intelligence, networks, and web programming. Im hoping to soon move on to learning about compilers and more algorithms.
