Hi! Iâ€™m @vaughnohlerking. I'm a senior studying for a Software Engineering major and Mathematics minor at Louisiana State University. As of late I have been really interested in algorithms and mobile app development. I'm currently learning about machine learning and interface design. Im hoping to soon move on to learning about more algorithms and mobile app development.
I'm hoping to find full time jobs in software development.
